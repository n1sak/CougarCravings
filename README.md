# CougarCravings
Cougar Cravings is an app where students can look up lunch menu items in the East Side Union High School District based on certain dietary preferences/restrictions the user may have. My goal is to to provide food safety for all public school students, solving the school lunch crisis!

The program will provide the user with food items that fit their wants. Users can:
- scroll through each food item that they can eat
- view nutritional information
- sort by ingredients to see what food items contain
